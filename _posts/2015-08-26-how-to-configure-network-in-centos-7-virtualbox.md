{% include JB/setup %}

Host: ubuntu 14.04
virtualbox 5.02
Guest: centos 7

**what i want:** under host machine, connect guest using ssh.

During the installation, i've only configured the guest machine's network setting to share the internet access with the host machine, using NAT.

Now we need to do is to create a virtual network adapter in virtualbox's networking settings.

and turn the created virtual network adapter in guest machine on.

by default, the ip address of the virtual adapter _vboxnet0_ is `192.168.56.101`, so now we should be able to ssh to the guest machine.

any questions? :)
